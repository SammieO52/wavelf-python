# here is one of the questions I solved

# Write a program that constructs a list from the given string's symbols and then prints it.
#The variable input_str has been defined for you. So, if input_str, for example, 
#contains a string "python", your program should turn it to the list ['p', 'y', 't', 'h', 'o', 'n'] and print it.

print(list(input_str))  # use the predefined variable "input_str" here
